# WorldLand Improvement Proposal (WIP) Submission Guide

WorldLand operates the WorldLand Improvement Proposal to encourage participation and innovation from the global open-source developer community. Through WIPs, you can propose improvements to the WorldLand network.

## 1. Preliminary Discussion
- Before drafting a WIP, thoroughly discuss your idea on the WorldLand forum (TBD).
- Refine the proposal based on feedback from the Foundation and community.

## 2. Official WIP Submission
- Submit the WIP draft to the official WorldLand repository as a Pull Request.
- In the WIP, clearly describe the proposed changes, their purpose, expected effects, and implementation plans.
- The WIP editor will verify that it meets the format requirements and assign a WIP number.

## 3. WIP Review and Evaluation
- The WorldLand Foundation and the WorldLand community will review and evaluate the proposed content.
- They will consider factors such as technical feasibility, economic utility, and alignment with the WorldLand vision.

## 4. WIP Adoption and Implementation
- Based on the evaluation results, the WorldLand Foundation and community will vote on the adoption of the WIP.
- Adopted WIPs will be reflected in the WorldLand roadmap and implemented sequentially.

We look forward to your innovative proposals that will shape the future of blockchain technology together with WorldLand. For more detailed information, please refer to WIP-1.
